# Word_Cloud

Overview:
Word clouds or tag clouds are graphical representations of word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. The larger the word in the visual the more common the word was in the document(s). This type of visualization can assist evaluators with exploratory textual analysis by identifying words that frequently appear in a set of interviews, documents, or other text. It can also be used for communicating the most salient points or themes in the reporting stage. 

A variety of word and tag cloud generators are freely available on the internet and the process for creating them is straightforward. Evaluators can simply import text (for example, a set of interviews) into a text box and the tool creates a graphical representation of the words. Most word cloud generators have features that allow users to change colors, font, and exclude common or similar words.

Technology used:
Python, Jupyter notebook

Usage:
A tag cloud (word cloud or wordle or weighted list in visual design) is a novelty visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.
